# Booru-Prompter

This Python application dynamically determines the **top 5 most popular characters** for each gacha series in the last two weeks, then fetches their image statistics.

## Features
- Dynamically finds the **top 5 most popular characters** for each series.
- Fetches images from the **last 14 days only**.
- Collects **character name, series name, number of images found, and aggregated tags**.
- Supports **rate-limited mode** (default) and **fast mode** (`--fast` flag).
- Saves results in a JSON file.

## API Documentation
This script uses the **Gelbooru API**:
- [Gelbooru API Docs](https://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=help&topic=dapi)

## Installation
1. Install Python (3.7+ recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

Run Normally (Rate-Limited)

By default, requests are limited to 1 per second:

```
python main.py
```

Run in Fast Mode (No Rate Limit)

If you want to disable the rate limit, use:

```
python main.py --fast
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This may hit API rate limits and cause errors.

Output

Results are saved in:

booru_gacha_results.json

Example JSON output:
```
[
    {
        "character_name": "Raiden Shogun",
        "series_name": "Genshin Impact",
        "num_images_found": 23,
        "aggregated_tags": ["thighhighs", "genshin_impact", "raiden_shogun", "cleavage", "solo"]
    }
]
```

# Notes

The Booru API used is Gelbooru, but this can be modified in config.py.

API rate limits may affect request speed.
